# NarrowsFiler
A tool for simplifying grabbing narrow pivot point files from EasyAlgo's Discord and loading them into Trading View.

### Stuff it does for you:
1. Sets the correct date for the file. Eg, if you downloaded the Weekly this Wednesday it will save the file with the date of last Sunday, nevertheless.
1. Lets you specify a file name if none of the standard 4 suit your file's contents.
1. Lets you choose your preferred exchange and substitutes EasyAlgo's preferred "ByBit" for your preference.
1. Lets you specify section names, which you can then use to classify assets in your watchlist.
1. Lets you save your preferences to a browser cookie.
1. Removes duplicate lines from the Combo file (or any other file you might also want to process)

You can directly use the tool, in your browser, from:
