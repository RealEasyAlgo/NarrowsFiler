# NarrowsFiler
A tool for simplifying grabbing narrow pivot point files from EasyAlgo's Discord, naming them in a useful way, adding extra details and saving them locally for subsequent loading into Trading View.

### Stuff it does for you:
1. Sets the correct date for the file. Eg, if you downloaded the Weekly this Wednesday it will save the file with the date of last Sunday.
1. Provides unique, dated names that include your chosen exchange name, for each of the four standard EasyAlgo narrows files.
1. Lets you specify a file name if none of the standard 4 suit your file's contents.
1. Lets you choose your preferred exchange and substitutes your preference for EasyAlgo's preferred "ByBit".
1. Lets you specify section names, which you can then use to classify symbols in your watchlist.
1. Lets you save your preferred exchange and section names to a browser cookie, so they're there ready for your next use.
1. Removes blank lines that cause TradingView to reject the whole file.
1. Removes duplicate lines from the Combo file (or any other file you might also want to process)

You can directly use the tool, in your browser, from:
